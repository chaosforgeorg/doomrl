0.9.9.7 -> 0.9.9.8

 * new prototype syntax for resistances -- resist = { resistance = value, ... }
 * level:explosion and being:apply_damage takes source item as parameter
 * kills.get and get_type only operate on string IDs
 * kills tracks "melee" and "other" separately

 * level.feeling property added; ui.msg_feel, ui.repeat_feel, and ui.clear_feel added:
   msg_feel(msg) prints msg and adds it to the level feeling.
   repeat_feel() prints the stored level feeling. (This is the function assigned to the SHIFT-L binding.)
   clear_feel() clears out the stored level feeling.  Level feeling automatically clears at level start.

 * custom awards for modules now possible
 * level:beings_in_range will now iterate over player too
 * NEW CONSTRUCTOR SYNTAX (see Wiki for updates)

 * item:disassemble() -> module.disassemble( item )
 * being OnPickUpItem hook added
 * removed player:record_badge, use player_data.get_counted('badges','badge',id) instead

 * styles -> Generator.styles
 * removed ifvalue, use core.iif instead
 * player data functions moved to player_data namespace (count, child_count), added (badge_count and weapon_kills)
 * removed blood and all blooded versions of tiles, use LFBLOOD instead
 * register_trait, register_klass and reset_trait_data removed from core, all
   klass and trait data is now looked up in lua as needed (can modify on the fly!)
 * disassemble is now a method of item
 * removed flag_set from prototypes -- flags is converted to set!
 * F_COSCOLOR, F_GLOW and F_OVERLAY flags remo1ved

0.9.9.6 BETA 1 -> 0.9.9.6 BETA 2
 * ui.msg_clear added
 * ui.draw_string and ui.clear removed, along with other immedate mode ui functions
 * vision value in prototype now relative to player vision (not relative in self.vision)

0.9.9.5 -> 0.9.9.6 BETA 1
 * level.special_name removed, general level.id added
 * beings and items are no longer indexed - any function operating on being/item
   array indices wont work anymore, also level props being_array_size and
   item_array_size have been removed
 * prototype table renamed to __proto, custom table renamed to __props
 * player.killedby removed -- now passed as an argument to print_mortem/OnMortemPrint
 * BF_INV works for enemies.

 * All player hooks have stubs and can be overridden.
 * Built-in AIs will reload with not enough but non-zero ammo.

 * level.items_in_range( coord/object, range ) and
   level.beings_in_range( coord/object, range ) iterators added
 * most of the level and being functions that accept a coord also accept a item or being and extract their 
   position instead. This is also more effective because we don't need to construct a coord in lua.

0.9.9.5 BETA 2 -> 0.9.9.5 BETA 3
 * entity.id now returns a string id
 * entity.sid is invalid
 * entity id's are no longer limited to 20 chars
 * table.toset is now table.to_set
 * new table functions are now available table.toset, table.copy, table.icopy, table.merge, table.imerge,
   table.reversed -- all table copying/merging is shallow!
 * SHOTGUN_ and MISSILE_ constants are no more, id's changed to be unique. Use string id's for prototype
   definitions and shotguns[ "" ].nid/missiles[ "" ].nid for changing ingame.

   Challenge hook OnBeingCreate is now OnCreate - works on items too, so remember to check!

 * item hook OnFire and OnAltFire revesed return (true continues, false breaks)
 * challenge hook OnFire  takes (item,being)
 * Level hook OnFire(item,being) added
 * Level hook OnFired(item,being) added
 * removed LF_MELEEONLY flag, use Level.OnFire instead
 * introducing HookChains -- first such chain is Item-Level-Challenge hooks OnFire and OnFired
 * HookChains for OnPickup and OnPickupCheck and OnFirstPickup (Item-Level-Challenge)
 * OnPickup and OnPickupCheck are also executed for beings!
 * beings use the same code to pickup as the player, so could be made to pickup e.g. powerups
 * lever OnUse must return a boolean value (true)
 * being:use is a full featured use - if passed nil, will attempt to use levers
 * HookChains for OnUseCheck and OnUse (Item-Level-Challenge)
 * OnUseCheck and OnUse are also executed for beings!
 * Module Hooks added - inserted into the current HookChain - use ModuleID.HookName for any module
 * OnKill, OnKillAll and OnEnter are now chained into Level, Module, Challenge
 * OnCreate, OnDie, OnDieCheck are now chained into (Being/Item), Level, Module, Challenge
 * Module API - use OnCreateEpisode hook instead of create_episode, OnGenerate instead of generate
 * OnMortem is not used for printing (but for things to check before score finalization) use OnMortemPrint instead
 * indexing the inventory will no longer work
 * you can destroy inventory items that you iterate through - they will be removed from inventory
 * thing methods now correctly can be ran through self:
 * inventory rehaul
 * LFPERMANENT *light*flag added, now controls permanency of walls per cell
 * removed all permanent versions of cells (all starting with p)
 * OnDieCheck can be properly hijacked (add)

0.9.9.4 BETA 1 -> 0.9.9.4 BETA 2
 * entities now need to be properly defined (have all required fields, none extra)
 * new AI's available -- built-in AI removed
 * removed old API flags - BF_USESITEMS, BF_HUNTER, BF_DISTANCE and BF_RETALITATE
   ( BF_HUNTER and BF_OPENDOORS will be removed later!)
 * all flagSet sets for prototypes are now flag_set
 * all soundID sets for prototypes are now sound_id
 * all ammoID props now named ammo_id
 * XP -> xp, HP -> hp, minLev -> min_lev, maxLev -> max_lev, toDam ->todam, toHit -> tohit, toHitMelee -> tohitmelee
   for being prototypes
 * MAXAFFECTS raised to 12 - feel free to add your own!
 * path_next and direct_seek return a coord as a second result -- either it's the coord that has successfuly been
   moved to, or it is the coord that blocked

0.9.9.4 -> 0.9.9.4 BETA 1
 * Episodic mods supported!
 * Multiple lua files in a mod supported

   used -- you create a tile using Generator.tile_new( map, trans ) (note the reverse order!) and place it using
   Generator.tile_place( coord, tile ) (also reversed!). Note however, that the Level.place_tile stayed the same!
 * Removed Level.place_chunk -- as thanks to the new Generator tile API it is just 3 lines -- see the Archi style
   generator for an example.
