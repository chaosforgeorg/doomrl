Introduction

DoomRL (abbr. for Doom, the Roguelike) is, as the name implies, a
roguelike game. If you don't know what a roguelike is... checkout 
wikipedia -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike.

DoomRL is based on the world from id Software's(tm) game Doom(tm). You're
the sole surviving marine from a squad sent to investigate a distress call
from the moonbase of Phobos.  It turns out that all hell has broken loose
on the plant... literally.

Your quest in DoomRL is to descend into the moonbase complex, find the
source of this evil outbreak, and destroy it at all costs.

Unlike many other roguelikes, DoomRL is intended to be simple and easy to
get into. To that end, there is a limited inventory, maps of the size of
one screen, and one item per tile.  The number of keys you need to 
remember is also quite small compared to many other games.


=============================================================================

Getting Started

When you first start a game of DoomRL, you're presented with a menu screen
with a few different options:

New game will, well, start a new game!
Challenge game is initially locked, and becomes unlocked after you reach
Corporal rank (need to survive 10 levels for it). Challenge games force you to
play the game a certain way (e.g. using only melee), and you can raise your
player rank in DoomRL by completing them. As your rank goes higher, more
challenges will be made available to you.
Custom game brings up a selection screen where you can view and load modules.
Modules are player-created levels, episodes, or entirely new games that bring
a completely new experience to the DoomRL engine.
Show highscores displays the highscore list, not surprisingly.
Show player displays your player statistics, which include your player 
rank, number of kills, and number of wins. It has several screens which can 
be scrolled with the arrow keys.
Help displays the help screen, which contains the info you are
currently reading.

For now, select New game with the arrow keys and press ENTER to start
your very first game of DoomRL!

Before you start your game, you have to make a few decisions. The first is
the difficulty level. At the beginning, only three difficulty levels are
available: "I'm too young to die", "Hey, Not Too Rough", and "Hurt Me
Plenty". At higher difficulties, more monsters appear and tougher monsters
appear earlier. "Ultra-Violence" and "Nightmare!" difficulties are unlocked
as your player rank rises. At Nightmare! difficulty, only the most insane
DoomRL warriors will stand a chance!

The second decision is choosing a character class. Classes differ by 
starting perks, availability of one advanced trait as basic, and each of
them has a different set of Master Traits.

The third decision you have to make is what your name will be in the game.
You can figure that much on your own, right? You can also leave it blank and
wear the name of a random legendary warrior...

The fourth and final choice to make is select a starting "trait". 
Traits are upgrades or "perks" that you earn when you gain levels in DoomRL 
(by killing monsters). Traits can raise your max health, let you run faster, 
deal more damage per shot, or otherwise make you more awesome. Some traits
can be levelled up individually.

You'll notice a few traits aren't available. Some are "Advanced Traits", and
require you to learn a normal trait first. Advanced Traits are more situational
but quite effective, too. The rest are master traits, which require you to take
a specific set of traits (and block off a few other traits) and give you some
sort of great unique bonus. But hey, don't think about it too hard. Just pick
one you like and move on.

And that's it, you're ready to play the game! After a brief intro, you will
be greeted with something like this:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Welcome to the Doom Roguelike...

 Doomguy                    Armor : none
 Health: 100% Exp:  1/0%    Weapon: pistol (2d4) [6/6]
 cautious                                                    Phobos Base Entry
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             The Starting Screen

This is a map of the first level of the moonbase on Phobos. The whole level
is exactly the size of the screen. Walk around (using the arrow keys or numpad)
and get used to the interface. Don't get yourself killed!

Take a look at the screen. It is divided into three parts. On top you have
the "message area", made of two lines of text. Watch this space carefully -- it
may notify you of impending danger or tell you that you're out of ammo (poor
sob!).

On the bottom you have the status bar. The top line displays your name, and
below it is the most important stat -- your health. If this one drops
below one percent, you're dead, dude - nothing can save you. Scanning 
to the right you can see the experience indicator. The first number is your
character level -- the higher it is, the tougher you are. The second number
is your experience displayed as a percentage. Each character level requires
a certain experience amount needed to achieve it.

Below your health and experience is "tactics". By default your tactic is
"cautious". This tactic gives no benefits or disadvantages. If you press TAB
once, it will change to "running" (note that changing tactics takes some
in-game time). With this tactic you have increased movement speed, dodge
chance, and defense bonus, but have a smaller chance to hit and reduced melee
damage. After some time spent running (or after pressing TAB again), you
will get "tired". Being tired has no effects, positive or negative (like
cautious), but while tired, you can't run again. You can return to the cautious
tactic by leveling up, gaining health by most methods, or descending to next
level. Since running is limited in this way, try not to waste it. At the same
time, however, remember to use it, as they don't stockpile for later levels.

In the column to the right of that, you have two indicators, "Armor" and
"Weapon", that show you what armor and weapon you have equipped. For weapons, 
the number in brackets indicates the damage that the weapon deals, and the two
numbers in square brackets indicate the current-loaded ammo and clip size for
that weapon (e.g., [4/6] means you have four bullets in a magazine that can
hold six).

Between the status bar and message bar, there's the map. The "@" sign with
the cursor below it -- that's you (aren't you ugly?). See any letters nearby?
It may be a "T"ree, but chances are it's the enemy. Kill'em all. The "#" are 
walls, "+" is a closed door, "/" an open door. Dots are normal floor. Red dots
are either Phobos's ugly rock landscape (on the first level), or blood 
(anywhere else).

Press "i" to see your inventory. It's pretty empty, right? Your character
starts equipped with a few things -- your trusty pistol (already equipped), a
handful of ammo, and a couple of med-packs. To check equipped item, press "e"
in-game to see the full list (which includes boots and a second weapon slot).

Your pistol and ammo are not going to last you very long, though.  Press
"g" to pick up new weapons (represented by "}") and ammo ("|").  If you
walk around that first level you're likely to run into some small medkits
(red "+") that you can pick up and add to your inventory. Later on you might
find other consumable items, they're all "+"s. Press "u" at any time to use
a consumable. If you ever want to drop something (usually to make room for
new weapons or items), press "d" to open the drop menu.

Along the way, you're bound to run into levers ("&") and barrels ("0"). To
pull a lever, stand on it and press "u" to use them. The effects are random,
so pull them at your own peril!  And if you've ever played Doom, you know
what to expect with barrels: They all explode quite nicely, but with varying
effects depending on the barrel. (Be aware that levers are activated with
the same button as using items -- in this case, open up your inventory and use
the item from there by selecting it and pressing ENTER.)

As you go deeper into the base, you'll also find some power-ups ("^"). They are
used as soon as you pick them up, and several contain powerful effect, so use
them wisely.

Oh, I almost forgot! To shoot, just press "f" -- you'll be asked for a target
(if you have a gun and proper ammo, that is...). Use the arrow keys to choose a
target, and press "f" again to fire. Or, you can press "m" to see an ASCII
image and description of what you are aiming at. You can also press TAB (when
targeting) to toggle between the targets. Some weapons allow an alternative
fire mode, such as the chainfiring mode of the chaingun.

Ok, I hear you cry -- "Out of ammo!" Don't panic. Press "r" to reload your
weapon. (Some weapons allow you an alternative reload by pressing "R".)
Reloading the correct ammo is automatic if you have it in your inventory. But
what if you don't? You can try pounding on the enemy with your fists or a
hand-to-hand weapon -- to do that just walk into him.  Pick up a Berserk
Pack or a chainsaw (or at least a knife) and you can do some serious damage
that way!

Getting hit too frequently when trying to approach an enemy (or when
running from him)? Try not to move in a straight line -- move diagonally, as 
this increases your chance to dodge. If you don't want to approach or
retreat from the enemy, but also don't want to be hit often, try moving
from side-to-side, perpendicular to the direction of enemy, as this
gives you the same bonus as moving diagonally). Sometimes, in emergencies,
switching to the running tactic and using both of these tricks at once will
give you a much greater chance to dodge than normal.

In the equipment menu (remember, press "e") you'll see that you have a primary
weapon equipped and a secondary weapon at hand.  By pressing "z" you can
switch your primary out for your secondary.  This is faster than equipping
a new weapon from your inventory and it saves you valuable space.  It's
also quite useful in a firefight, when the situation can change at any
moment!

Hey, you think you're cool because you found some armor? Think again. Look,
there are three numbers by the armor. The first two in square brackets are
[current damage resistance/maximum damage resistance]. The second one is 
your armor's health. 100% means it's undamaged, 1% is almost destroyed. The 
more damaged an armor is, the lower its actual resistance is. Keep an eye on 
those numbers!

Additionally each armor may grant additional resistance to specific damage 
types. This information can be obtained in the inventory and equipment 
screens.

Try to check out player information screen by pressing "@" -- some useful
information is written there. First, there are your main parameters: movement,
firing, and reloading speeds, as well as your chance to hit with the weapon
you currently have equipped (from point blank range). Next are the more passive
statistics: your player and dungeon level, amount of played turns, and your
score so far. At the bottom you can find parameters of equipment that you are
currently wearing: damage, firing and reloading speeds, and accuracy for
weapons; and protection value, durability, and movement and knockback
modifiers for armor and boots (yes, armor and boots can affect your movement
speed and chance to be knocked back by powerful attacks).

There are five types of items in this game:

1) Common - These items are... "common"? You will see them all across the
game, and what you should rely on. Most are generated randomly, but you will
find some are guaranteed in certain places (as a reward for completing a special
level, for example). Common weapons and armor accept 1/1, 3/2, and 5/3 mods, 
respectively, depending on the level of your Whizkid trait.

2) Assemblies - These items can be assembled from other items, usually 
common, by modding them with a specific set of mods. Experiment, as discovered
(assembled) assemblies will be recorded in your player data and can be accessed 
with the "A" key during the game.

3) Exotic - These items are rarer and more powerful than common items. They 
can potentially appear more than once per game, but are more often than not 
found in special levels. Exotic weapons and armor can hold the same amounts of 
mods that their common counterparts do.

4) Uniques - Unique items, as the name suggests, can only appear once per
game. Some of them just have cool stats, while others have special abilities,
and each of them come with a unique name. No unique item is guaranteed, although
they can appear in special levels, and they are quite rare otherwise. Most 
uniques cannot be modded, but those that do can only be modded if the player 
is playing the Technician class.

5) Artifacts - Artifact items are similar to unique items, except that they
can only appear in very specific special levels, while never appearing randomly.
Finding and collecting these items is almost always a very challenging task.

Mods (Displayed by a " symbol) are little packs that enhance your weaponry or
armor. Most equipment you find can be modded, so try to cover up their
weaknesses by modding them.

Whenever you see something that you aren't familiar with, press "l" to
trigger the Look command -- moving the cursor with the arrow keys will
show what's under the cursor in the message bar. You can also press "?"
in-game to open up the help menu.

Happy fragging!
