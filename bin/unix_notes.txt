To run doomrl you'll need lua5.1, timidity, sdl and sdl_mixer installed.

Known issues with Unix (Linux, FreeBSD) DoomRL versions:

1. DoomRL looks for its data files inside current directory,
   and it saves it's files (player data, scores etc.)
   also inside current directory. Practically, this means that

   a. you should always run doomrl from the directory where the binary is
      (e.g. using a script like `cd /<doomrl-directory>/; ./doomrl').

   b. it's not possible to install doomrl system-wide and to allow each
      user to have it's own save file.

2. It's known that DoomRL upon exit leaves the console in kind of
   messy state. This seems to be a problem in FPC Video unit
   and so far we didn't manage to find a solution.

Also, DoomRL requires that your console has size 80x25 or larger.
So make sure to adjust size of your console if needed.

You can run DoomRL using one of the scripts doomrl_gnome-terminal,
doomrl_konsole, doomrl_xterm etc. provided in the release.
They run the game in new X terminal window (so the 2nd issue is not
noticed), and set window size to be exactly 80x25.
You can add at their beginning a line like
  cd /<doomrl-directory>/
to somewhat get rid of the 1st issue too.
