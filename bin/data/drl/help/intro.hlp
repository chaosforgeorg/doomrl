{rIntroduction}

{rDRL} (abbr. for D, the Roguelike) is, as the name implies, a
roguelike game. If you don't know what a roguelike is... checkout 
wikipedia -- {Bhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike}.

DRL is inspired by a famous 1993 FPS hellish shooter. You're
the sole surviving marine from a squad sent to investigate a distress call
from the moonbase of Phobos.  It turns out that all hell has broken loose
on the plant... literally.

Your quest in DRL is to descend into the moonbase complex, find the
source of this evil outbreak, and destroy it at all costs.

Unlike many other roguelikes, DRL is intended to be simple and easy to
get into. To that end, there is a limited inventory, maps of the size of
one screen, and one item per tile. The number of keys you need to 
remember is also quite small compared to many other games in its genre.
