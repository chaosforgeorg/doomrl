The trip was long -- you thought it would never end. But hell, a marine's job is rarely interesting. You hate the UAC -- nothing ever happens here. Now you've got to sit around and wait for your squadmates, who are supposed to check out what happened on Phobos.

Not knowing what to do with yourself, you lean back near the comm console and listen for news from your fellow marines.

Once you beat the big badasses and clean out the moon base you're supposed to win, aren't you? Aren't you? Where's your fat reward and ticket back home? What the hell is this? It's not supposed to end this way!

It stinks like rotten meat but it looks like the lost Deimos base. Looks like you're stuck on The Shores of Hell. And the only way out is through...

You've done it! The hideous Cyberdemon lord that ruled the lost Deimos moon base has been slain and you are triumphant!  But ... where are you? You clamber to the edge of the moon and look down to see the awful truth.

Deimos floats above Hell itself! You've never heard of anyone escaping from Hell, but you'll make the bastards sorry they ever heard of you! Quickly, you rappel down to the surface of Hell.

The loathsome Spiderdemon that masterminded the invasion of the moon bases and caused so much death has had her ass kicked for all time.

A hidden doorway opens and you enter. You've proven too tough for Hell to contain, and now Hell at last plays fair -- for you emerge from the door to see the green fields of Earth! Home at last.

You wonder what's been happening on Earth while you were battling evil unleashed. It's good that no Hellspawn could have come through that door with you...
